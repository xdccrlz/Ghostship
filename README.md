If you're having any trouble after reading through this `README`, feel free ask for help in the Ghostship Support text channels. Please keep in mind that we do not condone piracy.

# Quick Start

Ghostship does not include any copyrighted assets.  You are required to provide a supported copy of the game.

### 1. Verify your ROM dump
The supported ROMs are US and JP versions. You can verify you have dumped a supported copy of the game by using the SHA-1 File Checksum Online at https://www.romhacking.net/hash/. 

* The SHA-1 hash for a US ROM is 9bef1128717f958171a4afac3ed78ee2bb4e86ce.
* The SHA-1 hash for a JP ROM is 8a20a5c83d6ceb0f0506cfc9fa20d8f438cafe51.

### 2. Verify your ROM is in .z64 format
Your ROM needs to be in .z64 format. If it's in .n64 format, use the following to convert it to a .z64: https://hack64.net/tools/swapper.php

### 2. Download Ghostship from [Releases](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Ghostship/releases)

### 3. Generating the OTR from the ROM and Play!
#### Windows
* Extract every file from the zip into a folder of your choosing.
* Run Ghostship.exe and select your US or JP ROM.

#### Linux
* Extract every file from the zip into a folder of your choosing.
* Execute Ghostship.appimage. You may have to chmod +x the appimage via terminal.

#### MacOS
* Extract every file from the zip into a folder of your choosing.
* Run Ghostship and select your US or JP ROM.

#### Nintendo Switch
* Run one of the PC releases to generate an `sm64.o2r` file. After launching the game on PC, you will be able to find these files in the same directory as `Ghostship.exe` or `Ghostship.appimage`.
* Copy the files to your sd card

#### Android
* Install the APK and launch it.
* Tap **Choose Super Mario 64 ROM** and pick your own US or JP `.z64`. It is checked against the supported hashes, kept in the app's own storage, and converted into `sm64.o2r` on the device — no PC step, and no game data ships with the app.
* Extraction runs once and takes a few minutes; the game starts by itself when it finishes.
* Mods and saves are managed from the **Mods** button, which appears next to **Menu** while the in-game menu is open. Everything also lives on disk under `Android/data/com.ghostship.android/files/`, so mods can be dropped into `mods/` with a file manager instead.

# Configuration

### Default keyboard configuration
| N64 | A | B | Z | Start | Analog stick | C buttons | D-Pad |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Keyboard | X | C | Z | Space | WASD | Arrow keys | TFGH |

### Other shortcuts
| Keys | Action |
| - | - |
| Esc | Toggle menu |
| Ctrl+R | Reset (inside levels) |
| F11 | Fullscreen |
| Tab | Toggle Alternate assets |

### Graphics Backends
Currently, there are three rendering APIs supported: DirectX11 (Windows), OpenGL (all platforms), and Metal (macOS). You can change which API to use in the `Settings` menu of the menubar, which requires a restart.  If you're having an issue with crashing, you can change the API in the `Ghostship.cfg.json` file by finding the line `"Backend":{`... and changing the `id` value to `3` and set the `Name` to `OpenGL`. `DirectX 11` with id `2` is the default on Windows. `Metal` with id `4` is the default on macOS.

# Custom Assets
Custom assets are packed in `.o2r` or `.otr` files. To use custom assets, place them in the `mods` folder.

If you're interested in creating and/or packing your own custom asset `.o2r`/`.otr` files, check out the following tools:
* [**retro - OTR and O2R generator**](https://github.com/HarbourMasters64/retro)
* [**fast64 - Blender plugin**](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/fast64)
